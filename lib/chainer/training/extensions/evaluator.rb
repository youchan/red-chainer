      # Trainer extension to evaluate models on a validation set.
      # This extension evaluates the current models by a given evaluation function.
      #
      # It creates a Chainer::Reporter object to store values observed in
      # the evaluation function on each iteration. The report for all iterations
      # are aggregated to Chainer::DictSummary. The collected mean values
      # are further reported to the reporter object of the trainer, where the name
      # of each observation is prefixed by the evaluator name. See
      # Chainer::Reporter for details in naming rules of the reports.
      #
      # Evaluator has a structure to customize similar to that of Chainer::Training::StandardUpdater.
      # The main differences are:
      #
      # - There are no optimizers in an evaluator. Instead, it holds links to evaluate.
      # - An evaluation loop function is used instead of an update function.
      # - Preparation routine can be customized, which is called before each evaluation.
      #   It can be used, e.g., to initialize the state of stateful recurrent networks.
      #
      # There are two ways to modify the evaluation behavior besides setting a custom evaluation function.
      # One is by setting a custom evaluation loop via  the `eval_func` argument.
      # The other is by inheriting this class and overriding the `evaluate` method.
      # In latter case, users have to create and handle a reporter object manually.
      # Users also have to copy the iterators before using them, in order to reuse them at the next time of evaluation.
      # In both cases, the functions are called in testing mode  (i.e., `chainer.config.train` is set to `false`).
      #
      # This extension is called at the end of each epoch by default.
